It is a common misconception that people with this condition love themselves. The truth is that they dislike themselves to a great extent.</p><p class=align-left>Their inflated arrogance, perfectionism, and self-flattery are what they use to hide their true feelings and identity, even from themselves. As they do not admit to being flawed, they project their insecurities on others through criticism.</p><p class=align-left>This category of people refuses to evaluate themselves as they are afraid of the truth. They are also emotionally dead and rely on validation from others, unlike what they portray to the outside world.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e41500687c7cfaa.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What is enmeshment in a relationship and how does one deal with it?</span></p></a><h2>Diagnosis of the god complex</h2><p class=align-left>Narcissistic Personality Disorder, which is the most appropriate <a id=https://www.seeker.com/why-do-some-people-have-a-god-complex-1792674002.html href=# title="god complex synonym" rel="nofollow noopener">god complex synonym</a>, is a rare mental disorder characterized by an inflated sense of self-importance, a deep need for admiration, entitlement, and an alarming lack of empathy for other people.</p><p class=align-left>As is evident in the definition god complex, the condition can get extreme to the point where someone with the disorder does not even view the people around them as humans. It is an obsessive preoccupation with power and status that gives it the moniker <i>god complex.</i></p><p class=align-left>All personality traits range from mild to severe.

Sense of entitlement</h3><p class=align-left>As these people consider themselves to be special, they always expect to receive favorable treatment when compared to those around them. They believe that they should always get what they want and expect others to comply with their wishes and demands.</p><p class=align-left>If you claim to be unable to meet their needs, they will deem you as useless. They also do not take such responses lightly and will use aggression to call you out for your incompetence.</p><h3>2. Grandiose sense of self-importance</h3><p class=align-left>This trait is characterized by an unrealistic sense of superiority where the individual believes that they are special and unique; thus, they can only relate and be understood by similar people.</p><p class=align-left>As they claim to be above average, they desire to be associated with people, things, and places that have high status.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/9da79168c0c6d0d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>We are not hiding again - Rapper Ikechukwu says as he finally shows off girlfriend (photo)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>They believe to be better than everyone else and expect to be recognized for this, even without doing anything significant. They are also known to exaggerate their talents and achievements.</p><p class=align-left>When talking about relationships, they rant about how much they contribute without mentioning the impact of any other party involved. They claim to be a great friend, partner, family member, or business associate and consider the people in their lives lucky to have them.</p><h3>3. Exploitation of others</h3><p class=align-left>These kinds of people lack the ability to identify with others. In other terms, they lack empathy and cannot put themselves in another person’s shoes to try and understand them. This is because they view others as objects to serve their needs.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, they take advantage of others whenever they need something said or done without caring how it will affect them. Generally, they do not care how their behavior affects those around them.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/58b3d9388f7e62ea.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>REPORT: How COVID-19 increased child labour in Lagos state (parents, children share experiences)</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you try to point it out, they will not understand as they only care about their needs and how they benefit from any situation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4e41500687c7cfaa.jpg><h3>4. Living in a world of fantasy</h3><p class=align-left>As reality does not support their grandiose view of themselves, they live in a fantasy world that is characterized by magical thinking, distortion, and self-deception.</p><p class=align-left>To make them feel like they are in control and unique from within, they spin self-glorifying fantasies of attractiveness, power, ideal love, success, and brilliance.</p><p class=align-left>These fantasies are meant to protect them from feeling empty and shame. Therefore, any facts and opinions brought up contradicting their fantasy are dismissed.</p><p class=align-left>Any comments or opinions that threaten to burst their fantasy bubble can be met with rage or extreme defensiveness. Therefore, those around such individuals learn to be careful about how they address issues with them as a result of their denial of reality.</p><h3>5. Demeaning, bullying, intimidating and belittling others</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/0f4368c9614ebf7e_b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Exclusive: Legit.ng's Managing Director shares 5 digital trends to boost your business in 2020</span></p></a><p class=align-left>When they meet people who appear to have something they lack, they tend to feel threatened. They do not like to feel challenged, especially by individuals that are quite popular or seem confident.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, they neutralize the threat by trying to bring the threat down. This can be done by dismissing their opinions or even ignoring their presence. Sometimes, they go to the extend of insulting, bullying, or even using threats.</p><h3>6. Need for constant praise and admiration</h3><p class=align-left>To keep them feeling like a god, these individuals need their ego fed. They try to surround themselves with those that constantly compliment them as they crave for affirmations at all times.</p><p class=align-left>As these relationships are often one-sided and most times, they never last for long. If the attention of the admirer is diverted, interrupted, or diminishes, the admired sees it as a betrayal.</p><h2>How to avoid being a victim of someone with a god complex</h2><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/ba471ea66eb848f3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>AMVERIFIED: Africa’s indigenous social network community</span></p></a><p class=align-left>These people are often very charming and magnetic at first as they appear to be composed and extremely confident. This is all because they are living in a fantasy world; thus, their lives tend to be very attractive to normal people as there is something different about them.</p><p class=align-left>It is important to note that this is just an illusion, and if you fall for it, you will end up getting hurt, with your self-esteem shattered at the end of it all. Therefore, this is how you avoid being a victim.</p><h3>1. Examine how they treat other people</h3><p class=align-left>When you meet someone, take time to not only evaluate how they treat you but also how they treat others. If they are disrespectful, manipulative, hurtful, and liars, they will eventually treat you the same way. Do not be deceived that you are different.</p><h3>2. Check on the fulfilment of your needs</h3><p class=align-left>As they are not usually looking for partners but obedient admirers, you need to check if your needs are being met. If you feel like your feelings and needs are irrelevant to the potential partner or friend, you need to leave.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/10e8f100b7c3b57d.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>OPINION: Why I support Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala’s candidacy for WTO DG</span></p></a><h3>3. Create healthy boundaries</h3><p class=align-left>The foundation of a healthy relationship is mutual care and respect. People suffering from a god complex are not capable of being in a healthy relationship.</p><p class=align-left>This is because they do not see, hear, or recognize others outside of how their needs will be met. Therefore, such an individual cannot meet the basic requirements of a healthy relationship, let alone those required to take a relationship to the next level.</p><h3>4. Have a plan</h3><p class=align-left>When seeking a new romantic relationship or friendship, write down what you are looking for. If you have a history of meeting abusive people, whether emotionally or physically, list down all the traits and behaviors that they had to avoid making the same mistake.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/3ca714c44eac2777.jpg><h3>5. Keep your boundaries</h3><p class=align-left>In any relationship, you need to be willing to uphold the boundaries you have created. This is the only way you will be taken seriously.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/491e20e10a0f39dd.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Petrol, electricity: Bill Gates makes crucial revelations, sends message to Buhari</span></p></a><p class=align-left>For instance, if you state that you always have to go home after a meetup or date, you always need to do this because when you do not, the other party will see that you are willing to adjust your boundaries to please them.</p><h3>6. Know yourself</h3><p class=align-left>When you know yourself, any type of negative comments or opinions from others will not mean anything. Therefore, when you come across someone with a god complex, you will immediately identify what they are trying to do and avoid their company.</p><h3>7. Kill the need for approval</h3><p class=align-left>It is important not to base your worth on anyone’s opinion. By doing this, you protect your self-esteem from being destroyed. You will also never have to do anything to prove a point to someone.</p><h3>8. Understand the scope of healthy relationships</h3><p class=align-left>To understand something, especially if you have not experienced it before, you ought to be presented with a clear picture of it. You can achieve this by interacting with people who have had similar experiences.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/a6063f18cd602f25.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Interesting details about emotional maturity: Definitions, signs, and ways get it</span></p></a><h3>9. Spend time with honest people</h3><p class=align-left>When you surround yourself with genuinely honest people that you confide in and who care about your well-being, they can help you identify, eliminate, and avoid toxic people from your life.</p><h2>How to leave someone with a god complex</h2><p class=align-left>By the time most people resort to leaving someone, it is usually after trying every possible alternative to save the relationship. Leaving a toxic friend, family member, or partner is not easy, but when you are suffering and in anguish, it is usually the best option.</p><p class=align-left>You do not necessarily leave because of hate. Sometimes, it must be done to put an end to emotional pain or abuse, feeling irrelevant, small and unopinionated, or even feeling ignored.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/2fff90ac765a7cc9.png><p class=align-left>We all deserve to associate with people who love us for who we are and not for what we have to offer.

Learn about this condition exclusively</h3><p class=align-left>Develop a clear understanding of the god complex and learn the techniques they use to exploit their victims manipulatively.</p><p class=align-left>With this understanding, you will be able to know which actions trigger certain actions from them. Having this kind of predictability will keep you a step ahead of them.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, for example, when you tell them that you want to end the relationship, they will often bring back the endless adoration and flattery that got you hooked to them. They could also make grand promises about special gifts or changing their behavior, which will never happen or be seen.</p><h3>2. List down the reasons why you want to leave</h3><p class=align-left>This will help you know precisely why you want change as you deserve the best of what life has to offer despite any mistakes you may have made in the past.</p><p class=align-left>Whenever you feel like you want to change your mind about leaving, you can check your list to remind you to stay on track. You can save it on your phone, laptop, diary, or anywhere that will be easily accessible.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/d85a947d88ae9f58.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Top 12 types of noses: which one is yours?</span></p></a><h3>3. Avoid making empty threats</h3><p class=align-left>Do not keep announcing that you will leave the abuser as they could make it harder for you. Just stay silent as you create a plan and leave when you are ready.</p><h3>4. Find support</h3><p class=align-left>During this period, you can fear being alone if it is something you are not used to.
