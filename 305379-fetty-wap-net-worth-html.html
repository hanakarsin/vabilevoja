This is easily seen through the type of vehicles he chooses to ride. His love for exotic <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">European motor vehicles</a> is common knowledge as seen in his collection that includes a BMW X5, BMW M6, and a Mercedes-AMG C63, not to mention the i8 coupe. He is one of the many celebrities whose love for BMW is evident.</p><p class=align-left>His 2016 BMW i8 is a beauty that almost all sports cars worth mentioning are. It comes with a gasoline-powered turbo engine together with an electric motor which is powered by a lithium-ion battery pack. The hybrid system offers up to 357 horsepower and a 420 lb-ft of torque. When the power is combined with a curb weight of under 3,500 pounds, it is not surprising that this particular BMW i8 can reach a maximum speed of 155 mph as well as have an ability to accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just 4.2 seconds.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f4d9d730f69bc23e.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=#><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How rich is Chief Keef?</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As if that is not enough, the car is even more unique due to its Level 2 charging station which has the ability to power the carâ€™s battery in a record time of two and a half hours. What this does is to allow the BMW i8 to attain an EPA-estimated fuel efficiency of 76 MPGe, while at the same time boasting of a total driving range of 330 miles. This type of fuel economy is impressive for a car of its kind and there will be no need for refueling every other time. The new BMW i8 coupe has a starting MSRP of $140,700. This can only mean that Fetty Wapâ€™s bank account is not struggling at all since he is able to afford the car comfortably.</p><h3>Fetty Wap house</h3><p class=align-left>Fetty bought a new house with his girlfriend Alexis Sky. The pictures of the two showing their newly purchased house continues to prove that Fetty is really doing well. He is also known to have bought his mother a brand new house.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/f894d1124105e9d4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Metro Boomin net worth, house, girlfriend, cars</span></p></a><p class=align-left>With Fetty Wap net worth at 8 million dollars, it is obvious that the young rapper has made a name for himself in a competitive niche.
