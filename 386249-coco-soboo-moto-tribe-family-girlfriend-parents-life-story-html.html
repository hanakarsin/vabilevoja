He is the only boy. From the middle name, it is assumed that Coco Sobo Moto tribe is Kikuyu. His family has spent much of its time moving between Kenya and South Africa, occasionally travelling to other parts of the world due to the nature of his parents' work.</p><h3>Coco Soboo Moto childhood</h3><p class=align-left>The media star admits he was not an easy child growing up. JahSeed grew surrounded with abundance only to turn out a spoilt child in his mid-teen years.</p><p class=align-left>At age 14, Coco accidentally found himself in the middle of drug abuse. He learned the habit of a man who sold ice cream around his school in Kenya. Clueless, Coco took his heroin laced ice cream and only became an addict by day.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d4eccadf10d65cf6.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Man Saimo (Simon Mburu): 5 facts about the Kameme FM presenter</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He would feel irritable over the weekends, not knowing that he was experiencing withdrawal syndrome. A year later, the Coco Sobo family relocated back to South Africa.</p><p class=align-left>In 1996, the fifteen-year-old spoilt Coco rediscovered heroin and instantly remembered its unique taste from the Kenyan ice cream portions. He would later worsen at being an addict.</p><h3>Coco Soboo Moto education</h3><p class=align-left>Upon completing his primary education in Kenya, Coco relocated to South Africa, along with his parents. He moved to Australia for further education at the college level. Coco regularly missed classes for as long as three weeks.</p><p class=align-left>His enrollment ended with almost an expulsion because the institution could no longer tolerate his absenteeism and performance. He decided to quit. Coco lately feels that he wasted his youthful years and is now going the extra mile in his career to recover all his lost years.</p><h3>Coco Soboo Moto career</h3><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2253d545b79f25b3.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amina Chao: 10 interesting facts you need to know about about Jalang'o's wife</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/b786df4451649b89.jpeg><p class=align-left>His parents provided him with everything until he was thirty years old. After that, Coco applied for an identification card and started working a couple of years later. He landed some good jobs but messed them all because he was still recovering from substance. A hearty laugh and a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">raspy voice</a> earned him good opportunities at One FM and Metro Radio, but substance abuse kicked him out.</p><p class=align-left>His job at Hot96 left him more alarmed and unwilling to place his new position on a bet with addiction. At first, Coco worked as an intern for four months, after which he went live with a late-night show and later a mid-morning show.</p><p class=align-left>Most importantly, the radio presenter is actively involved as a motivational speaker with a straightforward institutional discipline approach. Coco works with the famous First Ladies' Pupils Rewards Scheme, also called PURES. He strongly believes in mentorship as a tool for directing young people.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/2bc0373a9bb4c86b.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Shilole biography: husband, family, net worth, songs, life story</span></p></a><h3>Struggles with heroin</h3><p class=align-left>What started as a simple ice cream flavouring eventually ended in a full blast addiction. Coco would sell off random household items to meet his rising addiction demands. At the time, he did not realize he was getting off track because substance abuse was a new thing in his life.</p><p class=align-left>Coco Sobo Moto car accidents followed when his substance abuse habit escalated. He recalls surviving nine gristly car crashes, where the cars were damaged beyond<strong> </strong>repair, but he always came out alive. Unfortunately, these fatal experiences did little to break his substance abuse.</p><p class=align-left>Blacking out on the streets became a part of his life gradually and left him without a future.</p><h4>Rehabilitation and journey from addiction</h4><p class=align-left>The reggae star went into rehabilitation about 20 times before beating his addiction. He only became serious when his parents threatened to withdraw financial support. Kariuki has been in recovery for over 17 years, which involved going to Mathare North Health Centre for the daily dose of methadone. This is a substitute drug for heroin that reduces withdrawal symptoms.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/91b85ecd263a1701.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Mr Blue biography: family, net worth, songs, facts and latest updates</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Kariuki comes from a supportive family, which has been standing with him throughout the years. Coco Sobo parents particularly stand out in his life, thanks to their moral and financial support towards his full recovery from addiction. During his 40th birthday, Coco recognized his look-alike parents for funding his restoration with as much as Ksh. 500, 000. His caring parents did their best to ensure that their son recovers from addiction</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/d4eccadf10d65cf6.jpeg><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>Njugush biography: wife, kids, house, rise to fame, facts</p><h3>Love life and relationships</h3><p class=align-left>Coco and his ex-girlfriend Wanjiru Gatume shocked the public when they broke their seven-year relationship. Coco cited irreconcilable differences as the cause of their separation following years of recovery in which Shiru was a key player. Their parting ways came barely five years after Coco proposed to her at Diani during his sister's wedding. According to Coco, the two ex-lovers are still good friends.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/afe8820c3c5e2a18.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Rich Mavoko biography: wife, family, hometown, education, facts</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Who is Coco Soboo Moto wife?

Even so, fans have questioned his decision to declare yearlong celibacy after his rocky relationship with ex-girlfriend Wanjiru.</p><p class=align-left>Coco Soboo Moto has written history for defeating the highs and lows of life to become an accomplished media personality. He enjoys a broad base of supporters who look up to his example and mentorship.
