Letting kids know that they can come to their parents for help while encouraging them in situations where they have to figure out things for themselves is a priority for many. Nobody wants to raise a person who isn't self-sufficient.</p><p>Which is probably why this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter story</a> — posted by a father who has since been dubbed "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bean Dad</a>" — is getting such a wild response on the social media platform.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">John Roderick's Twitter story about his daughter learning to use a can opener earned him the nickname "Bean Dad."</h2><p>Podcaster <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">John Roderick</a> — who is also the lead singer and guitarist in the band The Long Winters — <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote about</a> an instance that involved his 9-year-old daughter and a can opener. The kid approached him saying she was hungry and John instructed her to make some baked beans. When she asked "how" he told her to put them in a pot to get the cooking process started. His 9-year-old daughter didn't know how to do that.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Personally, I was a mama's boy growing up, with my mom being a made-to-order cook for my and my siblings. It wasn't exactly the healthiest way to go about building a relationship with food; we had most of our favorite foods at our beck and call and since my mom was constantly cooking, there was an abundance of stuff to munch on throughout the day.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“With a can opener!” I said, incredulous. She brought me the can opener and we both stared at it. I realized I’d never taught her to use it. Most cans now have pull-tops. I felt like a dope. What kind of apocalypse father doesn’t teach his kid how to use a manual can opener?!?</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>So I said, “How do you think this works?” She studied it and applied it to the top of the can, sideways. She struggled for a while and with a big, dramatic sigh said, “Will you please just open the can?” Apocalypse Dad was overjoyed: a Teaching Moment just dropped in my lap!</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>So I was somewhat digging John's thought process in teaching his daughter how to open a can of beans herself to make a humble meal.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I said, “The little device is designed to do one thing: open cans. Study the parts, study the can, figure out what the can-opener inventor was thinking when they tried to solve this problem.” (The can opener is also a bottle opener, but I explained that part wasn’t relevant.)</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I went back to my jigsaw puzzle. She was next to me grunting and groaning trying to get the thing. I should say that spatial orientation, process visualization and order of operation are not things she... intuits. I knew this would be a challenge. But it was a rainy weekend.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>However, like most people when faced with a tedious task, John's daughter soon became exasperated at the prospect of discovering how to correctly use an unfamiliar mechanism all on her own.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Eventually she collapsed in a frustrated heap. I said, “Explain the parts.” She said, “This little wheel is meant to cut, these gears turn the wheel when you spin the handle. This other wheel looks like a gear but isn’t.” She couldn’t figure out the clamping step, a key element!</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I said, “The tool is made to be pleasing but it doesn’t have any superfluous qualities. Everything that moves does so for a reason.” She said, “I hate you.” I’m sure she believes that she does. I said, “You understand everything except how the tool addresses the can.” She sighed.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>But the dad wasn't backing down and he seemed dead set on his daughter learning how to use a can opener herself.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>At this point she said, “I don’t want baked beans” and marched off. Apocalypse Dad went into full ‘The Road’ Mode! “Sweetheart, neither of us will eat another bite today until we get into this can of beans.” She screamed “AUGH!” like Lucy Van Pelt. She read a book for awhile.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Soon she was back at the can. The top was all dented now, the lip of the can practically serrated from failed attempts. We studied the tool some more. She really wanted it to be oriented up and down or across the top of the can. The sideways orientation is very counterintuitive.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>He then chronicled her entire journey of learning how to use the can opener and the peripatetic process of finally opening the can.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She was fixated on orienting the tool in a few configurations and couldn’t imagine other possibilities. I compared the can opener to other tools. By now we were working on anger-management and perseverance too. She suggested she open the can with a hammer. There were tears.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I told her stories of some of the great cans I’d opened over the years. She rolled her eyes. We talked about industrial design and what a funny little device the opener is. I showed how I open cans with a Buck knife. I rhapsodized about cold Spaghetti-Os straight from the can!</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>Hours and hours went by as he dedicated himself to solving the jigsaw puzzle, and she had extra impetus to learn how to use the can opener as he said she wouldn't eat any food if she couldn't figure out how to get the can opened with the tool.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Eventually she had it all figured out. She had the placement of the tool, she could turn the handle and the can would spin (we were down on the floor by this point), but the “kachunk” of puncturing the lid still eluded us. We’d been at it for SIX HOURS on and off. We were hungry.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’d been tempted many times along the way to guide her hand. I wanted her to experience the magnificence of the can opener SO MUCH I couldn’t stand the suspense. Neither of us likes baked beans that much—the cupboards are bare—so it seemed like a paltry reward for this work.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>But John seemed dedicated to teaching his daughter to "follow through" on something, in a way of correcting his own parenting "mistakes" growing up.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’d forgotten how finicky the tool really is, particularly when it comes to the puncture. She had it all lined up! But the cutting wheel is a little wobbly (by design) and you have to really get on top of it to clamp it down. You know the feeling? You can misfire the damn thing!</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Finally she squeezed down on it and, although it was a misfire, a light went off in her head. Many times throughout the day she’d yelled at me, “My brain is fuzzy! I can’t think of anything else to try!!!” and I’d say, “When your brain doesn’t work, trust your hands.”</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She felt the tool click over the lip of the can. I saw it in her hands. By this point she’d developed a little ritual of addressing the tool to the can: starting with it on a vertical axis and rotating it to the horizontal while clamping down in a single motion. A choreography.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She looked at me expectantly, excitedly. After six hours of trying you don’t want to express too much hope. Was this another blind alley? The can had been through hell, label ripped off, dented, sharpened and burred, a veteran of a thousand psychic wars. She knew, though.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She set up again, carefully, and brought the Swing-a-Way to bear on the can of S&W baked beans with the meticulousness of Roger Moore extracting a detonator from an ICBM in The Spy Who Loved Me. A soft pop resounded in the room, so different from all the other sounds we’d made.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She didn’t look up. She knew the action. A little baked bean sauce appeared. She savored each twist until the lid, as I hoped it would, rewarded her by standing perfectly at attention, saluting her effort and ingenuity. She was elated and carried it to the kitchen in both hands.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>She knew this was a commonplace task and a common tool but also that this was serious business. She knows her dad, and the stock I put in these things. A more mechanically inclined kid might have figured it out in minutes. She factored the scale, but was rightfully proud.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m proud of her too. I know I’m infuriating. I know this is parenting theater in some ways. I suffer from a lack of perseverance myself, and like all parents throughout history I’m trying to correct my own mistakes in the way I educate my child. She sees through this.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The Swing-a-Way can opener is a little voodoo doll for us now. It will reappear as an allegory many more times in her life, you can be sure. She knows this too. But this is an allegory of triumph. I wish I had more of those for myself. I wish I had more stories like this.</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>The only problem is now she wants to open every fucking can in the house!</p>— john roderick (@johnroderick) <a href=#>January 2, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><p>After sharing his entire thread on Twitter, tons of people chimed in to share their opinion of his tale.
