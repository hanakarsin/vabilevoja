It is safe to say that the number has drastically increased in 2024.</p><p>However, with Nigerians migrating to other countries, some have been unfortunate and have found themselves deported back to their country.</p><p>Aside from seeking greener pastures, many Nigerians travel for business reasons, some for academic purposes, some searching for jobs, while some seek to live better lives away from the stress of home.</p><p>To guide your ‘japa’ decision, <strong>Naija News</strong> reveals ten countries that would benefit Nigerians planning to migrate.</p><p><strong>1. Canada</strong></p><p>Canada’s official languages include English and French. Recently, Nigerian citizens seem to have fallen in love with the country.</p><p>Canada now boasts a vast number of Nigerians owing to their friendly immigration criteria.</p><p>The North American country is the second-largest second to Russia.</p><p>A Nigerian with relevant skills, academic qualifications, and job qualifications can go through the provincial nomination system or the federal express entry migration system. Another way is by securing a Canadian job with a Canadian employer.</p><p>It would be easier to get a permanent residency if you obtained your high school and college certificate in English Language and have a master’s degree.</p><p>Canada also supports migration with family if you want to live with your wife, children, parents, and siblings. Obtaining Canadian citizenship takes about three years.</p><p><strong>2. Switzerland</strong></p><p>Switzerland’s official languages include French, German, Romansh, and Italian.</p><p>Switzerland is a beautiful country with a good quality of life, and it also has a low rate of unemployment.</p><p>However, you should know it takes up to 10 years to earn citizenship in Switzerland.</p><p><strong>3. Australia</strong></p><p>Australia, described as the next big thing after the United Kingdom and Canada for Nigerians, has been cited as one of the best countries to migrate to as a Nigerian.</p><p>The country, aside from the distance, offers quality life to all, irrespective of race or religious background.</p><p>Australia, just like Canada, is continuously seeking skilled labour from different parts of the world to fill up vacant slots in workplaces.</p><p>Despite its extreme weather, Australia has recorded a high influx of immigrants from around the world (Nigeria included).</p><p><strong>4. Poland</strong></p><p>Poland is a great country as it offers excellent opportunities for survival. It is an ideal country for Nigerians who wish to relocate abroad.</p><p>The country has a rich culture and encourages diversity among dwellers. Poland is budget-friendly. Their local currency is called the Polish Zloty.</p><p>Depending on your work type, you could earn about 150 to 300 dollars a day.</p><p>However, there has reportedly been a very high visa denial rate in 2024.</p><p><strong>5. Singapore</strong></p><p>Singapore speaks English, Mandarin Chinese, Standard Mandarin, Tamil, and Malay.</p><p>As one of the wealthiest countries in the world, Singapore is one of the best countries for Nigerians to migrate to.</p><p>The country is an Island and is regarded as one of the global financial centres of the Asian continent, with a small population.</p><p>You will need an employment permit to get started, and attaining citizenship could take as much as ten years.</p><p><strong>6. Germany</strong></p><p>Germany is a top European country and a dream country for most migrants, but getting a visa to the country is not easy.</p><p>Germany is an excellent choice for Nigerians who want to relocate abroad</p><p>The country is quite populated, with as many as 80 million people, but not more populated than Nigeria. To fit in, you might want to learn some basics of their language, German Deutsch.</p><p>Germany boasts a robust economy and is far ahead of many countries.</p><p><strong>7. Hungary</strong></p><p>It is quite possible to get a visa to Hungary very quickly.&nbsp;It is one of the best countries that Nigerians can easily migrate to.</p><p>Places like Budapest and Debrecen are cities you would love to live in.</p><p>The local Hungarian currency is called the Hungarian Forint. With about 15 dollars, your meal for the day is sorted. Accommodation per night could take you about 20 to 25 dollars.</p><p><strong>8. Slovakia</strong></p><p>Slovakia shares borders with Hungary, Poland, Ukraine, the Czech Republic, and Austria in central Europe. They use Euros as their local currency.</p><p>Known for mountainous areas with a small population of about 5 million people, its capital city is Bratislava.</p><p>If you are good with budgeting and managing your expenditure, it won’t exceed about 40 dollars per day (feeding plus accommodation).</p><p><strong>9. Belgium</strong></p><p>Belgium is a European country with many native English and French speakers. It is another country to migrate to from Nigeria as well quickly.</p><p>One of the easiest ways to get a permanent residency and eventually citizenship in Belgium is by getting a job there.</p><p>The Belgium residency program also enables you to relocate to Belgium permanently with your family.</p><p>If you are a beer and chocolate lover, Belgium is the country for you.</p><p><strong>10. United Arab Emirates</strong></p><p>The United Arab Emirates is a tax-free nation and has a very low crime rate. It attracts people from all over the world, too. The UAE is a popular destination among expats: about 80% of the country’s population are foreigners.</p><p>Though many believe the country mostly favors Muslim immigrants, UAE is home to millions of Christian migrants from different nations of the world.</p><p>UAE is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, with a thriving business sector and a range of opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e49rZpyZnpaxonnPqKOappRir6a4xqKspmVhZXqjsdKtZJynpaPBs7XErGSnoZeav6qtzaxknJmeYr%2BmuM6cmK2dXZ%2Busa2MraZmnqWhuW64yKyraA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcanada-poland-belgium-10-best-countries-nigerians-can-relocate-japa-to-full-list.html&text=Canada%2c%20Poland%2c%20Belgium...%2010%20Best%20Countries%20Nigerians%20Can%20Relocate%20%28Japa%29%20To%20%5bFull%20List%5d&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcanada-poland-belgium-10-best-countries-nigerians-can-relocate-japa-to-full-list.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcanada-poland-belgium-10-best-countries-nigerians-can-relocate-japa-to-full-list.html&title=Canada%2c%20Poland%2c%20Belgium...%2010%20Best%20Countries%20Nigerians%20Can%20Relocate%20%28Japa%29%20To%20%5bFull%20List%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcanada-poland-belgium-10-best-countries-nigerians-can-relocate-japa-to-full-list.html&title=Canada%2c%20Poland%2c%20Belgium...%2010%20Best%20Countries%20Nigerians%20Can%20Relocate%20%28Japa%29%20To%20%5bFull%20List%5d" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcanada-poland-belgium-10-best-countries-nigerians-can-relocate-japa-to-full-list.html&title=Canada%2c%20Poland%2c%20Belgium...%2010%20Best%20Countries%20Nigerians%20Can%20Relocate%20%28Japa%29%20To%20%5bFull%20List%5d" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcanada-poland-belgium-10-best-countries-nigerians-can-relocate-japa-to-full-list.html&description=Canada%2c%20Poland%2c%20Belgium...%2010%20Best%20Countries%20Nigerians%20Can%20Relocate%20%28Japa%29%20To%20%5bFull%20List%5d" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./2023-court-dismisses-suit-challenging-atikus-eligibility-to-contest-for-presidency.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Court Dismisses Suit Challenging Atikus Eligibility To Contest For Presidency">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./390423-businessman-married-wife-dating-her-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Businessman says he got married to wife without dating her">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
