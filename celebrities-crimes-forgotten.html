Crimes that happened 20, 30 years ago that were swept under a rug are now being uncovered by internet sleuths who spend way too much time on Wikipedia. Although people expect celebs to have a D.U.I. or a drug charge in their record, most would be pretty shocked to learn their fave has been charged with attempted murder or a hit-and-run. And surprisingly, it happens more than you think. Below, some huge stars who have major crimes in their past.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">1. Will Smith was arrested in connection to an assault that left a man blind in one eye.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Even during his rap days, Will Smith was never someone who had run-ins with the law. After all, he's so squeaky clean he doesn't even curse in his records. However, shockingly, he has one arrest in his history that he's desperately tried to keep under wraps. In 1989, the then-20-year-old rapper/actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was arrested on assault charges</a> after an argument left a man severely injured. Allegedly, Will asked his bodyguard to "attack" record promoter William Hendricks. The assault left William with fractures around his eyes, causing him to lose his sight in one eye.&nbsp;</p><p>"Will had to spend a night in the cell at the West Philadelphia police station with other inmates waking him up all night long and asking for his autograph," the National Enquirer reported at the time. "It was the worst night of his life. He wants to forget it ever happened." The charges were later dropped, and the story was mysteriously never brought up again.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">2. Sean Penn allegedly assaulted Madonna while they were married.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Madonna's tumultuous first marriage to Sean Penn all ended in 1988 after an alleged incident took place. Although there have been lots of conflicting reports, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christopher Andersen’s Madonna: Unauthorized</a>, who interviewed the police officer who was there that night, Sean broke into her house and allegedly tortured her for hours:</p>"Gagged, tied up, and trembling with fear, Madonna waited for hours for &nbsp;help to arrive. Incredibly, Penn returned, swigging tequila from a &nbsp;bottle, and began tormenting her all over again.This time, she managed &nbsp;to persuade him to untie her. Once free, she dashed out of the house, &nbsp;jumped into a coral-colored 1957 Thunderbird Penn had bought her for her &nbsp;twenty-eighth birthday, locked the doors, and called the police on her &nbsp;car phone. She then sped off to the Malibu sheriff’s station to swear &nbsp;out a complaint against her ex-husband. There, bruised and bleeding, she &nbsp;told the horrifying story of her nine-hour ordeal to dumbstruck &nbsp;officers."<p>However, a week after the incident, Madonna decided <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">not to press charges</a>. Since then, she has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">denied the whole thing even happened</a>, even though police who were there that night have said otherwise. “When Madonna staggered into the station, she &nbsp;was distraught, crying, with makeup smeared all over her face," Lieutenant Bill McSweeney was quoted in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Madonna: An Intimate Biography</a>. “I hardly recognized her as &nbsp;Madonna, the singer. She was weeping, her lip was bleeding and she was&nbsp;all marked up. She had obviously been struck." Sean still maintains that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he didn't do anything.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">3. Matthew Broderick killed two people after driving on the wrong side of the road.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>As much as we love the Ferris Bueller star, Matthew too has skeletons hiding in his closet. One such incident took place in 1987 while he was vacationing in Ireland. While driving a rented BMW, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">plowed head-on with a Volvo</a> driven by two women, killing them instantly. As for Matthew, he broke his right leg and suffered a collapsed lung. "I don’t remember the day," he said at the time. "I don’t remember even getting up in the &nbsp;morning."&nbsp;</p><p>Despite accidentally killing two people, Matthew avoided being convicted and instead got way with merely paying a $175 fine for reckless driving.&nbsp;In 2002, Matthew <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">promised to meet up with the family</a> of the deceased for closure. But in 2012, the family revealed that the meeting <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">never happened</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">4. Halle Berry was involved in a hit-and-run.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In another car-related incident, Halle was accused of crashing her car into a woman and then leaving the scene of the accident. The other driver, Hetal Raythatha, alleged that the actress ran a red light and plowed into her car, then fled the scene. According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, Halle pleaded no contest in court and was sentenced to three years probation and fined $13,500. According to Hetal's attorney, Halle was involved in two other hit-and-run incidents prior to that. Halle, surely you can afford to just take a cab?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">5. Mark Wahlberg committed several hate crimes before he became famous.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>He might be a big movie star now, but back in the '80s, Marky Mark was an angry kid with violent tendencies. More disturbingly, all his crimes were racially motivated. In 1986, he chased a group of young black kids while shouting, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Kill the n----r!"</a> In 1988, he approached a Vietnamese man named Thanh Lam and bashed him over the head with a wooden spoon, knocking him unconscious. That same day, he punched Hoa "Johnny" Trinh in the eye for literally no reason. When cops showed up to arrest him, Mark <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">boldly declared</a>, "You don't have to let him identify me, I'll tell you now that's the mother-*&^*@ whose head I split open."</p><p>Although he was sentenced to two years in prison, he only served 45 days of his sentence. Today, Mark's worth $225 million. As for Johnny, the man who got punched unprovoked, he's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">now blind in one eye.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">6. Naomi Campbell used to routinely beat up her assistants.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Naomi and her infamous temper is pretty well-known and has been treated as a cutesy joke among fans. But the severity of her assaults against her assistants, housekeepers, and staff are actually <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">worse than you think</a>. In 2004, a housekeeper accused Naomi of "slapping, kicking, and scratching" her. Another assistant that same year accused the model of holding her hostage in a Los Angeles hotel. Two years later the accusations rolled in again, with one assistant accusing Naomi of physically abusing her and even throwing her passport into a hotel pool.&nbsp;</p><p>Naomi was eventually sentenced to community service, but she hardly took it seriously. She showed<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> up in designer outfits, fedoras, and furs </a>while working at a sanitation garage. The whole thing was turned into a cutesy photo spread for Vogue and quickly swept under a rug.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">7. Tim Allen spent two years in prison.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's hard to imagine him as anything other than a lovable TV dad, but back in 1978, he was arrested for dealing cocaine. He pleaded guilty and served two years and four months in federal prison. Today, he doesn't talk about his past much, but in 2011 he opened up to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a>. "I was put in a holding cell with twenty other guys — we had to crap in the same crapper in the middle of the room — and I just told myself, I can't do this for seven and a half years... The comic in me showed up, the purest form, and saved my life."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">8. Dr. Dre reportedly beat up a television reporter and tried to throw her down the stairs.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>There have always been rumors about the rapper's violent nature against women, but when his biographical film Straight Outta Compton came out in 2015, many wondered why the movie skipped over his many assault charges. One such incident involved Pump It Up host Dee Barnes. According to a statement issued by Dee, Dr. Dre didn't like how he was portrayed on her show. When he saw her at a record party, he did the unthinkable, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone </a>reported:</p>"Dre picked her up and &nbsp;'began slamming her face and the right side of her body repeatedly against a wall near the stairway' as his bodyguard held off the crowd. &nbsp;After Dre tried to throw her down the stairs and failed, he began &nbsp;kicking her in the ribs and hands. She escaped and ran into the women’s &nbsp;restroom. Dre followed her and 'grabbed her from behind by the hair and &nbsp;proceeded to punch her in the back of the head.' Finally, Dre and his bodyguard ran from the building."<p>Dr. Dre didn't even deny the allegations and seemed to think beating up a woman was completely justified. "It ain’t no big thing," he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> at the time. "I just threw her through a door.”</p><p>However, after much backlash, in 2015 he released a statement to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> where he apologized.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">9. Jay-Z once stabbed a guy.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The rapper's gang past is no secret, but the fact that he tried to murder someone is. In 1999, he stabbed a record producer and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">pleaded guilty</a> to it three years later. Besides getting three years probation, the crime went largely unnoticed.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">10. Christian Slater assaulted his girlfriend in a drug-fueled rage.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The 49-year-old actor has always struggled with drugs but is currently going through a career resurgence with his role on Mr. Robot. Back in 1997, he was convicted of assaulting his then-girlfriend in a drug-fueled rage. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to police</a>, Slater was found swinging his arms and yelling &nbsp;incoherently. When a man tried to stop him from punching his girlfriend, a fight ensued. He later told police that he had been taking heroin, cocaine and drinking for several days with no sleep. He later spent three months in jail and three months in rehab.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">11. Brandy was involved in a fatal crash that killed someone.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>Most people wouldn't expect the squeaky clean R&B singer to have anything suspicious in her past, but in 2006, she was involved in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fatal collision</a> that took a woman's life. Brandy was driving her Range Rover at 65 mph without realizing the cars in front of her had slowed down. Her car then collided with the rear of the other driver's vehicle, causing a domino effect that involved two other cars rear-ending each other. Brandy got lucky and was never charged or arrested for her involvement, however, she has been sued multiple times by drivers involved in the crash, and all cases were settled out of court.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">12. Sylvester Stallone was accused of assaulting a teen in 1986.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The action movie star has two sexual assault allegations against him that only recently have come to light. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one allegation</a>, a 16-year-old girl accused him of assaulting her by forcing her into a threesome with his bodyguard. The actor <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">vehemently denied</a> the claims, however, in 2018, LA prosecutors announced that they were<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> working on a sex crimes case</a> against him, but they didn't provide any other details than that.&nbsp;</p><p>You hear that, celebs?
