Who is she and what do we know about his cause of death?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>It's not secret that the Eagles were one of the most pivotal bands of the 1970s. With classic yet well-trodden hits like "Hotel California" and "Take It Easy," they solidified themselves in a music pantheon that included peers like Fleetwood Mac and Led Zeppelin. Despite their infamous anger issues, directed primarily at the press and their label, the Eagles continue to resonate with fans new and old.</p><p>As the Eagles ready themselves for a farewell tour that spans two months in late 2023, it's hard not to think about their late guitarist Glenn Frey who passed away in January 2016. Outside of the band, he was a married father of three at the time of his death. It was later revealed he left everything to his wife. Here's what we know about Cindy Millican<strong> </strong>as well as Glenn Frey's cause of death.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Glenn Frey's wife was the sole benefactor of his fortune.</h2><p>In legal documents obtained by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TMZ</a> in November 2017, Cindy Millican is listed as his sole benefactor. She was also named the executor of Glenn's estate, "leaving her responsible for distributing his personal items like jewelry, clothing, and furnishings based on his wishes." The couple was married for 25 years, although Glenn "suggested famed Eagles manager Irving Azoff and attorney Barry Greenfield serve as co-executors if, for some reason, his wife couldn't serve."</p><p>Cindy only had a copy of Glenn's will, which she shared with the court. Unless it was contested, that wouldn't be a problem. The documents listed $100,000 in assets along with a "family trust, which likely contains the bulk of his wealth," per TMZ. They shared daughter Taylor, sons Deacon and Otis.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Cindy, who reportedly met Glenn while shooting a music video, is also active in the nonprofit world. In 2013, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lupus LA newsletter</a> highlighted Cindy's work with fashion designer Donna Karan. Cindy, who suffers from Lupus, was named to be part of the Donna Karan Ambassador Program to help raise awareness about the devastating disease.</p><p>In 1992, Cindy and Glenn were made aware of a charity based in Aspen, Colo. called A Grassroots Aspen Experience which "brought at-risk-youth from all over the United States to Aspen for empowerment exercises, mentoring, and counseling." Together they raised money through "fundraisers, lectures, and concerts," with Cindy eventually serving on the organizations board for five years. Oh and by the way, she is also friends with Kris Jenner who has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted about Cindy on Instagram</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kris Jenner (@krisjenner)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What do we know about Glenn Frey's cause of death.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR</a> reported that Glenn passed away Jan. 18, 2016, due to "complications from rheumatoid arthritis, acute ulcerative colitis, and pneumonia." His family released a statement on the Eagles website which read: "The Frey family would like to thank everyone who joined Glenn to fight this fight and hoped and prayed for his recovery. Words can neither describe our sorrow, nor our love and respect for all that he has given to us, his family, the music community, and millions of fans worldwide."</p><p>In a separate statement, Eagles singer and drummer Don Henley credited Glen for starting the band. Don said, "He was the spark plug, the man with the plan. He had an encyclopedic knowledge of popular music and a work ethic that wouldn't quit." Don also added that Glenn was "funny, bullheaded, mercurial, generous, deeply talented, and driven." Don made sure to mention that Glenn "loves his wife and kids more than anything."</p><p>Two years after his death, Cindy filed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wrongful death lawsuit</a> against Mount Sinai Hospital and gastroenterologist Dr. Steven Itzkowitz. As of the time of this writing, the case is still open.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnLmmus1mnaudqWLEqrLE</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fglenn-frey-wife.html&text=Late%20Eagles%20Guitarist%20Glenn%20Frey%20Left%20All%20of%20His%20Fortune%20to%20His%20Wife%20of%2026%20Years&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fglenn-frey-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fglenn-frey-wife.html&title=Late%20Eagles%20Guitarist%20Glenn%20Frey%20Left%20All%20of%20His%20Fortune%20to%20His%20Wife%20of%2026%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fglenn-frey-wife.html&title=Late%20Eagles%20Guitarist%20Glenn%20Frey%20Left%20All%20of%20His%20Fortune%20to%20His%20Wife%20of%2026%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fglenn-frey-wife.html&title=Late%20Eagles%20Guitarist%20Glenn%20Frey%20Left%20All%20of%20His%20Fortune%20to%20His%20Wife%20of%2026%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fglenn-frey-wife.html&description=Late%20Eagles%20Guitarist%20Glenn%20Frey%20Left%20All%20of%20His%20Fortune%20to%20His%20Wife%20of%2026%20Years" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./1302179-owen-omogiafo-meet-woman-leads-biggest-firms-africa-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Owen Omogiafo: Meet woman who leads one of the biggest firms in Africa">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./shawn-rogers-cheating-rumors.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Eygpt's Relative Claims That Shawn Is Cheating on Tee Tee on 'Growing Up Hip Hop'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
