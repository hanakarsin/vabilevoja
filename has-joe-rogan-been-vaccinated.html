There was a bit of confusion propagated by the CDC and NIAID in the beginning when it came to masks. At first, we were advised against wearing masks unless they were N95s, but it was recommended that those be reserved for essential and frontline workers.</p><p>But then a month later, that recommendation changed, which was the start of a clear division between those <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who were pro- and anti-face coverings</a> and, eventually, pro- and anti-vaccine. This was the beginning of a greater social bifurcation regarding the severity of COVID-19, and tons of prominent media personalities, <a href=#>Joe Rogan</a> included, shared their thoughts on the way the pandemic was handled.</p><p>Select sound bites from Rogan have folks wondering about his "stance" on the pandemic, and many are wondering: Has he been vaccinated?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Joe Rogan has tested positive for COVID-19.</h2><p>In a new Instagram video post on Sept. 1, 2021, the comedian talked about feeling "run down." He said he'd decided to isolate from his family as a precaution, and, after getting tested, he discovered he'd contracted COVID-19. As a result, his Nashville comedy show was moved to Oct. 24, 2021.</p><p>Joe said that he more than likely caught the virus while being on "the road" and working new stand-up routine material.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Joe Rogan (@joerogan)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some hospitals refused to give Ivermectin to patients to treat COVID — Joe says he's treating himself with the drug.</h2><p>WedMD defines Ivermectin as "an anti-parasitic drug that is used to treat river blindness and intestinal roundworm infection in humans and to de-worm pets and livestock." The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CDC</a> has warned against humans using Ivermectin for COVID-19, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">FDA doesn't approve</a> using the drug either. However there's been a spike in usage since reports surfaced online <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">about its efficacy in treating the virus</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Has Joe Rogan been vaccinated against COVID-19?</h2><p>On his immensely successful podcast, Rogan told comedian <a href=#>Bill Burr</a> during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic that he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">doesn't wear masks outdoors</a> and belittled the idea of wearing one. This, coupled with erroneous remarks he made about vaccines keeping <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">certain virulent strains</a> alive in individuals, thus opening the door for transmission in a larger population, has led many to believe the comedian is anti-vax.</p><p>Rogan, however, countered the claim, stating that while he believes vaccines can help some people, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"young and healthy"</a> individuals do not need to be vaccinated. This is false; no matter how young or healthy a person is, they are susceptible to a serious case of COVID-19 and would benefit from vaccination.</p><p>The comedian went on to further clarify his comments, stating, "I'm not an anti-vax person. I believe they're safe and encourage many people to take them."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Joe Rogan: I'm not putting that COVID vaccine in my body! Who knows what it could do?</p><p>Also Joe Rogan: I got COVID so I took monoclonal antibodies, Ivermectin, Little Debbie Cosmic Brownies, Z-Pak, some pills I found stuck in the cabinet, steroids, and long expired Crystal Pepsi.</p>— Josh Jordan (@NumbersMuncher) <a href=#>September 1, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Can vaccinated people still contract COVID?</h2><p>In a New York Times article, Dr. Rochelle Walensky stated, "A modest percentage of people who are fully vaccinated will still get COVID-19 if they are exposed to the virus that causes it."</p><p>So has Joe Rogan been vaccinated against COVID-19? He hasn't stated whether or not he has, but here's what we know.</p><p>Working in entertainment, traveling to specific areas, and booking venues are much easier now. It's likely that Rogan, like many other traveling employees, would have received his COVID-19 vaccine. There's also the fact that he's discussed the benefits of vaccines and stated that he isn't against vaccinations.</p><p>Also, Rogan did state earlier this year that both of his daughters contracted COVID-19 and thankfully recovered from the illness without any complications.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wonder if Rogan the has been has been vaccinated. And how does he stand on Voter IDs?</p>— Bill Kaye (@bkayetwit) <a href=#>August 10, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">However, Joe Rogan has expressed his fear in mandating "vaccine passports."</h2><p>During episode #1693 of The Joe Rogan Experience, the comic warned that requiring public proof of vaccination in order to travel freely was moving the United States of America "one step closer" toward a dictatorship.</p><p>"When you give people freedom, you let people do whatever the f--k they want to do, they actually find ways to succeed and grow and thrive,” Rogan said.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@joerogan</a> is often cited at work as to why people didn’t get vaccinated. Guy literally caused the third wave we are seeing now. Has <a href=#>@joerogan</a> been vaccinated yet?</p>— Justin Shibe 🧢🍍🍍🍍 (@LLepsdog) <a href=#>August 5, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Has Joe Rogan ever said if he's been vaccinated? I check his twitter for the first time in months, and it's just retweets of anti vax stuff. What's with this guy?</p>— JohnRidesADV (@RidesAdv) <a href=#>August 10, 2021</a></figure><p>"But as soon as you put the boots to them, as soon as you tell them, 'You have to do this, or you can’t do that. You have to listen to me,' now you have a mini dictator. You have one step away from a king. One step closer. You’re moving one step closer to dictatorship. That’s what the f--k is happening," he continued.</p><p>"That's what's gonna happen with a vaccine passport. That's what gonna happen if they close borders."</p><p>The fact that Joe's taking Ivermectin to treat the virus, despite major medical regulatory bodies cautioning against its efficacy, suggests that he may have elected against getting a shot designed to help inoculate people against COVID-19.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>@joerogan</a> has been vaccinated and like all the other agit-prop dudebros is verbally shitposting his message to get the rubes riled up and sow chaos.
