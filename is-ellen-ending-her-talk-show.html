Less than two weeks later, it was confirmed that Warner Media (who produces the show) was conducting an internal investigation about the claims.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, people started to wonder whether Ellen is ending her talk show in light of everything that has been happening surrounding her and the show over the past year. It wasn't until May of 2021 that the world learned the truth: The Ellen show is ending — but not right away. Here's what we know.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Ellen DeGeneres ending her talk show?</h2><p>On May 12, 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Daily Mail</a> revealed that Ellen will be ending her show after Season 19, which is set to finish airing in 2022. The outlets reports that a source close to the host said Ellen "has had enough and told her team that she's done."&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"She's promised one more season after this one and will exit at the end of the 2021/2022 season — the 19th season of the show. The ratings have tanked and have been truly appalling this year and Ellen knows her time is up."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The news doesn't come as a complete surprise — Ellen has considered ending the show before.</h2><p>In 2018, Ellen revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a> that December that she had been weighing her options when it came to her long-running show.&nbsp;At the time, Ellen was reportedly "considering a much bigger change, retiring from the long-running hit show that bears her name," citing her hit game show Ellen's Game of Games and Netflix special Relatable as opportunities that might make take her away from daytime TV.&nbsp;</p><p>But the celebrity, who featured on Forbes' "Richest Self-Made Women List" for her impressive <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$275 million net worth</a>, also told supermodel Gisele Bundchen she was not ready to retire, in an episode that aired around the same time.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>And it seems she was torn by the opinions of her trusted brother and her much-adored other half, Portia de Rossi. Portia told the Times that her wife is "such a brilliant actress and stand-up" that she doesn't need "this talk show for her creativity."</p><p>Meanwhile, her brother thought she owed it to America to stay on TV, at least while former President Trump was still in office, "making the case that, in the age of Trump, the country needs her positive, unifying voice on television every day."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Ellen ended up listening to her brother and extending her contract through the 2021 to 2022 season. Ellen herself called her afternoon program "escapism for what's going on, one hour of feeling good," and went on to say that "at the core, it's a comedy show. But if it's not funny, at least it feels good." But it looks as though the she will not be extending her contract again, and 2022 will be the last year we see new episodes of Ellen on TV.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Ellen's show has been at the center of some controversy for the past year.</h2><p>Ellen's show mantra may be "Be kind to one another," but per several of her former employees, that wasn't the feeling shared behind the scenes.&nbsp;</p><p>In March of 2020, writer/comedian <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kevin Porter posted a viral tweet asking</a> people to share their experiences with Ellen being mean. The thread received thousands of comments, including many responses about Ellen's on-set behavior.</p><p>At around the same time, an interview clip of NikkieTutorials began circulating from the Dutch series <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">De Wereld Draait Door.</a></p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In it, the makeup expert said that Ellen didn't acknowledge her until she was in front of the guests, and she "wasn't as nice" as she was expecting.&nbsp;Soon after, Calum Scott said that he was told not to look Ellen directly in the eye.&nbsp;Several months after the first frenzy regarding Ellen's off-camera persona,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> BuzzFeed News</a> posted a piece that included statements from 10 former staffers on the show, and one who was still employed there.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>While many said that the senior employees and executives were problematic, they acknowledged that Ellen is ultimately the one who should control the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>"If she wants to have her own show and have her name on the show title, she needs to be more involved to see what's going on. I think the executive producers surround her and tell her, 'Things are going great, everybody's happy,' and she just believes that, but it's her responsibility to go beyond that," one former employee stated.</p><p>The former staffers detailed their experiences with microaggressions on set, instances of overt racism, and tactics of intimidation. Afterwards, three executive producers, Andy Lassner, Ed Glavin, and Mary Connelly, issued a statement to BuzzFeed.&nbsp;</p><p>"We are truly heartbroken and sorry to learn that even one person in our production family has had a negative experience. It's not who we are and not who we strive to be, and not the mission Ellen has set for us," their statement began.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"For the record, the day to day responsibility of the Ellen show is completely on us. We take all of this very seriously and we realize, as many in the world are learning, that we need to do better, are committed to do better, and we will do better," it concluded.&nbsp;</p><p>Less than two weeks after BuzzFeed News published the article, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> confirmed that Warner Media had sent along a memo to employees about conducting an investigation into the allegations.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>When the show returned for the premiere of Season 18, Ellen began the episode with a monologue addressing the allegations against her and apologizing for some of her behavior. "As you may have heard this summer, there were allegations of a toxic work environment at our show,” she said. “And then there was an investigation. I learned that things happen here that never should have happened. I take that very seriously. And I want to say, I am so sorry to the people who were affected. I know that I’m in a position of privilege and power. And I realized that with that comes responsibility, and I take responsibility for what happens at my show.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How long has Ellen had her talk show?</h2><p>After 1998's culture-breaking moment that was Ellen coming out on national television, most of America was supportive of the actress' candor and bravery. But the haters, including her network ABC, which canceled Ellen soon thereafter, were definitely salty about her move.</p><p>The public opinion left her dejected, and she didn't make her comeback to TV until 2003, when she started The Ellen Show. Which means she's been doing the talk show for 16 years now, and at least two more seasons are still to come. The only person who's been on the air for longer than Ellen is Conan O'Brien.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"No other current daily host has been as successful or celebrated," writes The New York Times of her many accolades, which include 32 Emmys and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, no big deal.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusculnKdllaOxqrrGZp%2Beql2prq23jKyfqK8%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fis-ellen-ending-her-talk-show.html&text=Is%20Ellen%20Ending%20Her%20Talk%20Show%3f%20Season%2019%20Is%20Confirmed%20to%20Be%20the%20Last&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fis-ellen-ending-her-talk-show.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fis-ellen-ending-her-talk-show.html&title=Is%20Ellen%20Ending%20Her%20Talk%20Show%3f%20Season%2019%20Is%20Confirmed%20to%20Be%20the%20Last" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fis-ellen-ending-her-talk-show.html&title=Is%20Ellen%20Ending%20Her%20Talk%20Show%3f%20Season%2019%20Is%20Confirmed%20to%20Be%20the%20Last" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fis-ellen-ending-her-talk-show.html&title=Is%20Ellen%20Ending%20Her%20Talk%20Show%3f%20Season%2019%20Is%20Confirmed%20to%20Be%20the%20Last" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fis-ellen-ending-her-talk-show.html&description=Is%20Ellen%20Ending%20Her%20Talk%20Show%3f%20Season%2019%20Is%20Confirmed%20to%20Be%20the%20Last" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./262820-makueni-county-sell-branded-milk-process-mangoes-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Makueni becomes first county to sell branded milk, process mangoes">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./black-market-dollar-to-naira-exchange-rate-today-30th-january-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Black Market Dollar To Naira Exchange Rate Today 30th January 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
