Unfortunately for most people, that's exactly what they had to look forward to on the <a href=#>Monday after the Super Bowl</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Plenty of people would love for the Monday after the Super Bowl to become a national holiday. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a survey from the company DraftKings</a> — which was conducted by the polling firm SurveyGizmo — found that 40 percent of American sports fans would rather give up another work holiday than show up to their jobs the Monday after the Super Bowl. They would much rather rather forfeit Presidents Day, Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, or Columbus Day than stumble into work exhausted and hungover.</p><p>But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">petition as they might</a>, sports fans are likely never going to get their wish.</p><p>For those who are desperately grasping for something to make one of the most hellish of Mondays the tiniest bit better, we've rounded up some <a href=#>memes to get you</a> through the first day of the workweek. Because literally no one wants to be working the worst Monday of the year, but hopefully some of these memes will help to numb the pain.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This would be an easy solution, wouldn't it?</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">I do the same thing for Valentine's day chocolate, duh.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If everybody would just wait until the Monday after the Super Bowl, the tickets will be half price</p>— An English Human (@English_Channel) <a href=#>February 7, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This is technically keeping sports and politics separate...</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Sunday is the Super Bowl.<br>Monday is the 2nd impeachment.</p><p>BUY EXTRA SNACKS.</p>— BrooklynDad_Defiant!
