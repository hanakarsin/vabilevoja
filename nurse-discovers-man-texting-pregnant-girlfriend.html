A couple of hours go by and then, out of nowhere, they walk into your job.</p><p>At first, you're happy! What a sweet gesture, who doesn't love being surprised by their significant other? Is he coming to chill with you on your lunch break? Maybe he just wanted to pop in to brighten up his (and hopefully your) day?</p><p>But when he makes eye contact with you, his eyes widen and his mouth drops â€” he looks like he's seen a ghost. Your confusion only lasts a little while, because almost immediately, you see why he's so freaked out and it's because his pregnant girlfriend is trailing behind him for a scheduled c-section appointment.</p><p>That's what TikToker Lae Penny (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@officiallaepenny</a>) said she encountered while she was pulling a shift at the hospital she works in â€” her viral clip detailing the shocking storytime that's accrued over 1.3 million views on the popular video-sharing application.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@officiallaepenny href=#>@officiallaepenny</a><p>I have no words . Like no way <a title=storytime href=#>#storytime</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=foryou href=#>#foryou</a> <a title=fypã‚·ã‚šviral href=#>#fypã‚·ã‚šviral</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - LAE PENNY ðŸ¥µ" href=#>â™¬ original sound - LAE PENNY ðŸ¥µ</a> <span>Source: TikTok | @officiallapenny</span></figure><p>"Y'all I'm still processing what just happened but I need to talk this out before I crash out because what the f---! Why am I at work right now and that guy," she states while pointing to someone off-camera, she laughs before the clip cuts to her after she composed herself.</p><p>"The guy that's been talking to me for the past few months just walked up with his baby mother," she chuckles.</p><p>"His baby mother!" she repeats. "His baby mother that's about to give birth. Okay. Wow!" she says shaking her face into the camera.</p><p>"Comes in here, soon as he sees me his face drops. I'm confused, and quickly enlightened because the mother is behind him with the belly before her," Lae says into the camera.</p><p>"Wow!" she repeats again. "Wow!" she exclaims before giving further context into the situation:</p><p>"For those of you confused, I work at a hospital, OK? You get to see everybody and their mother, including the guy that you're talking to. The guy that you're talking to and his expecting baby mother," she says shouting into the camera.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @officiallapenny</span></figure><p>To make matters worse, Lae says, the guy she was talking to didn't even stop to consider that running into her would be a possibility, and he didn't seem to think anything of the fact that he was going to have a baby with another one on the same day that he was texting her.</p><p>She seemed stunned by "the audacity."</p><p>"Can you make this up? No. And it's like, she's coming in here for a scheduled c-section, meaning, you knew, you knew that today you were gonna have a baby but you're texting me, wow!"</p><p>Now maybe you, as the reader, are trying to give the guy the benefit of the doubt. Maybe, you're thinking, he had a one-night thing with his baby mama and she got pregnant.</p><p>Maybe he's being a stand up guy and just going to the hospital with her support because he wants to see the birth of his child, right? And the reason why his face dropped is because he felt guilty about hurting Lae's feelings and putting her in that position.</p><p>But then she went on to further discuss what happened between the guy she was talking to and his baby mama. Judging from the way she addresses it, it seems like they could very well be in an intimate relationship.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @officiallapenny</span></figure><p>"And then she's like oh babe, grab the bag. Babe grab the bag. Just when I thought it could've been your sister, babe grab the bag? What the f---?"</p><p>Lae went on to say that she opted not to say anything or make a stink because she wanted to ensure that the pregnant woman was going to have as happy a delivery experience as possible.</p><p>"And it's like your sitting there with the dumbest face on and because I'm a woman first, I don't want this girl blood pressure running through the roof or her having a bad pregnancy experience or delivery experience but wow! Treacherous. Treacherous. Treacherous. Treacherous!"</p><p>"The part that makes this s--- crazier is the fact that he just texted me two hours ago. So, what was your excuse gonna be whilst being in the delivery room? I was asleep? Bro..." she says at the end of the clip looking into the camera.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @officiallapenny</span></figure><p>Numerous TikTokers expressed their shock after hearing Lae's story, but there was another person, who, unfortunately underwent something similar: "My nurse was so weird to me when I had my son and come to find out she was sleeping with my son's dad and she just couldnâ€™t control her disbelief that I had just had his baby," they penned.</p><p>Others applauded her for considering the woman's feelings before saying anything: "I love that you thought of her in the situation and didnâ€™t want to ruin her birthing experience."</p><p>Which was a sentiment someone else echoed, penning: "Props to you for considering her before yourself in all of this! Thatâ€™s admirable!"</p><p>"The way I respect you for thinking about her delivery experience. I love you so bad for that!!!" another remarked.</p><p>One person who responded in the comments section who said they work as a nurse has been in situations were guys would come in with two different baby mamas in the same ward at the same time: "L&D nurse here; it def can happen! Iâ€™ve experienced when they got two BMs on the unit at the same time! but this my worse fear!"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo8Kzv8Rmm6Krk6TDpr7SZqSapl2psrnAyKeeZqiimrSvrc2tZKChoqGzs7XEp5s%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnurse-discovers-man-texting-pregnant-girlfriend.html&text=Nurse%20Discovers%20Man%20Shes%20Seeing%20Has%20a%20Pregnant%20Girlfriend&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnurse-discovers-man-texting-pregnant-girlfriend.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnurse-discovers-man-texting-pregnant-girlfriend.html&title=Nurse%20Discovers%20Man%20Shes%20Seeing%20Has%20a%20Pregnant%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnurse-discovers-man-texting-pregnant-girlfriend.html&title=Nurse%20Discovers%20Man%20Shes%20Seeing%20Has%20a%20Pregnant%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnurse-discovers-man-texting-pregnant-girlfriend.html&title=Nurse%20Discovers%20Man%20Shes%20Seeing%20Has%20a%20Pregnant%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnurse-discovers-man-texting-pregnant-girlfriend.html&description=Nurse%20Discovers%20Man%20Shes%20Seeing%20Has%20a%20Pregnant%20Girlfriend" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./sam-holland-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Sam Holland - Age, Family, Bio">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./nigerians-must-reject-same-faith-ticket-in-2023-northern-christian-elders.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nigerians Must Reject Same-faith Ticket In 2023">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
