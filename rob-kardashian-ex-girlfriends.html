If you add together their respective Instagram accounts, their hit show <a href=#><u>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</u></a>, and the many interviews they have all done over the years, you can piece together their lives pretty well. The same doesn't really go for <a href=#><u>Rob Kardashian</u></a>, to an extent.</p><p>He isn't featured on KUWTK and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his Instagram</a> is no longer managed by him, making him one of the more elusive members of a family that is known for oversharing everything. Still, Robâ€™s ex-girlfriends have always managed to push him back into the spotlight, however unwilling he might be each time. And even though he hasn't yet settled down completely, itâ€™s hard not to want to look back on all of Robâ€™s past girlfriends throughout the years.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Adrienne Bailon</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Rob and Adrienne Bailon were basically babies when they dated from 2007 to 2009. To be fair, they were adults, but they were both young and it was back when KUWTK was a little simpler and the Kardashian dynasty hadnâ€™t yet become a thing. Things took a drastic downturn when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rob cheated on Adrienne</u></a> and admitted to it on the show. How very un-cheetahlicious of him.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Angela Simmons</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Maybe it was the fact that Angela Simmons was also part of a family reality show, Growing Up Hip Hop, or that they ran in some of the same social circles, but Rob also had a short-lived romance with Russell Simmonsâ€™ niece. It's hard to say if youâ€™d call them boyfriend and girlfriend, but she is essentially another one of his exes from the past.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Rita Ora</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>ðŸ™ƒ</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>RITA ORA</a> (@ritaora) on Jan 24, 2020 at 11:36pm PST</p></figure><p>You might say that karma got the upper hand when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Robâ€™s relationship with Rita Ora</u></a> resulted in her allegedly cheating on him. In 2012, they ended their relationship amid Robâ€™s now-deleted tweets claiming that the singer had cheated on him multiple times with different men. The rumors weren't confirmed by Rita at the time, but with how public the breakup was, their split was probably for the best.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Demi Lovato</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Even though they never publicly dated, thereâ€™s a chance something sparked between <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rob and Demi Lovato</u></a>, at least for a little while. Back in 2013, he tweeted about taking little sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner to one of Demiâ€™s concerts and was shortly after spotted with her outside of a bowling alley. Even if nothing came of their potential bowling date, itâ€™s not out of the realm of possibilities to think they may have dated for a little while.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Blac Chyna</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty</span></figure><p>One of Robâ€™s most infamous relationships has to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>with model Blac Chyna</u></a>, who is also the mother of his daughter. The couple began dating in 2016, despite reports that his family <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">disapproved of the relationship</a>. Their relationship was short-lived and full of ups and downs and now, it seems, they are done as a couple for good. Letâ€™s hope it stays that way.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Alexis Skyy</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Rob was rumored to be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>dating Alexis Skyy</u></a> in January 2019. They even posted similar videos on social media of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Alexis cooking for him</u></a> in his home. At the time, she said on Instagram that she loved Rob, but if they were serious, their relationships seems to have been short-lived. Like most of Robâ€™s relationships, things may have fizzled out behind closed doors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Stassie Karanikolaou</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>This is another relationship that may have been more casual than anything, but when people caught Rob getting close to Kylie's friend <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Stassie Karanikolaou</u></a> at Kendall's birthday party in November 2019. He was then spotted with his hand around her waist at Drakeâ€™s Halloween party and that was all anyone needed to see to declare a new couple. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like much came of the potential romance, but she is still a kind of / sort of ex.</p><p>Despite what you might think of Rob or the other Kardashians and Jenners, thereâ€™s no denying that his most public relationships prove his love life is better kept behind closed doors. Thereâ€™s a reason why Rob seems to prefer to live his life low-key rather than right in front of the cameras.</p><p>Watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians on Thursdays on E! at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7yjecqaqZ2Zo522orqMnq9mn5mnuae%2ByJ6lnas%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frob-kardashian-ex-girlfriends.html&text=Rob%20Kardashian%27s%20Exes%20Show%20How%20Much%20He%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Public%20Relationships&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frob-kardashian-ex-girlfriends.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frob-kardashian-ex-girlfriends.html&title=Rob%20Kardashian%27s%20Exes%20Show%20How%20Much%20He%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Public%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frob-kardashian-ex-girlfriends.html&title=Rob%20Kardashian%27s%20Exes%20Show%20How%20Much%20He%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Public%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frob-kardashian-ex-girlfriends.html&title=Rob%20Kardashian%27s%20Exes%20Show%20How%20Much%20He%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Public%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frob-kardashian-ex-girlfriends.html&description=Rob%20Kardashian%27s%20Exes%20Show%20How%20Much%20He%20Doesn%27t%20Need%20Public%20Relationships" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-peter-obi-is-meeting-with-nigerians-abroad-labour-party.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Peter Obi Is Meeting With Nigerians Abroad">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kathleen-scott-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kathleen Scott - Trivia, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
