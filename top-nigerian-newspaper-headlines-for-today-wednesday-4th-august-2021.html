style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Good morning Nigeria, welcome to Naija News roundup of top newspaper headlines in Nigeria for today Wednesday, 4th August 2021</h2><p>The Federal Government has threatened to sack any civil servants caught doing leaking official documents on social media and other platforms.</p><p>In a circular dated August 2, 2021, Head of the Civil Service of the Federation, Dr Folasade Yemi-Esan, said her office would be relying on the provisions of the Public Service Rules 030401 and 030402 in dismissing those who continue to leak official documents.</p><p>The circular read in part, “The attention of the Office of the Head of the Civil Service of the Federation has been drawn to the incessant unauthorised disclosure of official documents/information on social media platforms.</p><p>“The unwholesome practice involves posting/reposting of secret, confidential and classified government correspondences, policy drafts, minutes, notes, memos, etc., on social media.</p><p>“This reckless action is tantamount to a breach of the Oath of Secrecy public servants swore to, and serious misconduct which may lead to dismissal from the service, as provided in the Public Service Rules 030401 and 030402.</p><p>“Henceforth, any officer caught posting/reporting government documents on social media and other platforms without authorisation would be severely disciplined in accordance with the provisions of the PSR.</p><p>Some members of the National Working Committee (NWC) of the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) have resigned from their positions.</p><p>Naija News understands the members that resigned explained they could no longer work with the party’s current national working committee (NWC).</p><p>Those who resigned include: the Deputy National Financial Secretary, Deputy Legal Adviser, Deputy National Auditor, Deputy National Publicity Secretary, Deputy Women Leader, and Deputy Organising Secretary.</p><p>They however added that they remain loyal to the party despite resigning from their positions.</p><p>Human rights activist and constitutional lawyer, Mike Ozekhome (SAN) has declared that the United States can’t just pick up embattled DCP Abba Kyari like a common criminal despite the allegations against him.</p><p>According to Ozekhome, Kyari is presumed innocent until proven guilty and section 36 of the Nigerian constitution protects him.</p><p>The lawyer made the submission on Tuesday when he spoke on Sunrise Daily, a Channels Television programme.</p><p>According to him, despite the treaty between both countries, America can’t just swoop in and arrest a Nigerian citizen in his/her own country without the permission and knowledge of the federal government.</p><p>Naija News recalls Kyari has been suspended by the Police Service Commission (PSC) based on the recommendation of the IGP following allegations against him by suspected international fraudster, Ramon Abbas, better known as Hushpuppi.</p><p>The super cop has however denied any wrongdoing.</p><p>The Chief Judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja, Justice John Tsoho, has ordered the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to unfreeze the bank account of the founder of Daar Communications Plc, Raymond Dokpesi.</p><p>Delivering ruling in an application filed and argued by Kanu Agabi SAN, on behalf of Dokpesi, Justice Tsoho ordered that the account domiciled at First Bank of Nigeria be immediately unfreezed since the criminal charges, which precipitated the restriction on the account had been dismissed and Dokpesi discharged and acquitted by the Court of Appeal.</p><p>According to the judge, the Federal Government has no basis to put a post-no-debit order on the account in view of the subsisting and valid order of the Court of Appeal.</p><p>He held that since the Court of Appeal delivered the judgment that invalidated the criminal charges against Dokpesi, the EFCC had not applied for stay of execution of the judgment.</p><p>The Cheif Judge said in the absence of a stay of execution, his court was bound by law to give effect and implementation to the judgment.</p><p>Scores of Boko Haram-ISWAP terrorists have been eliminated while their gun trucks were also destroyed in a well-coordinated joint operation of the air component and the ground troops in Gubio, Borno State.</p><p>According to PRNigeria, at least four gun trucks belonging to the criminal elements were destroyed by airstrikes of a Nigerian Air Force (NAF) alpha jet while ground troops pursued and eliminated fleeing terrorists.</p><p>The insurgents were killed on Monday during an encounter with the military jet, sent to provide close-air supports to ground forces at Gubio.</p><p>A source said that the ground troops at Gubio were initially confronting the invading terrorists when the NAF jet on a different mission was instructed to proceed to the Gubio axis.</p><p>The United Arab Emirates, UAE, has announced the lifting of the ban on transit flights from Nigeria and five other countries.</p><p>The National Emergency and Crisis Management Authority (NCEMA), in an official post on Tuesday via its Twitter handle, noted that the ban suspension will take effect from Thursday, 5 August.</p><p>Naija News reports that the countries where the flight ban had been lifted include India, Pakistan, Sri Nepal, Nigeria and Uganda.</p><p>NCEMA said that passengers travelling from countries where flights had been banned would be able to transit through its airports from August 5 as long as they present a negative PCR COVID-19 test taken 72 hours prior to departure.</p><p>Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State has revealed why the All Progressives Congress (APC) is against the electronic transmission of election results.</p><p>In a statement on his official Facebook page on Tuesday, Wike alleged that the reason the APC does not want the electronic transmission of election results is that President Muhammadu Buhari does not want free and fair elections in the country.</p><p>He also described those that who voted against electronic transmission of results as enemies of the country.</p><p>The governor asserted that the decision of APC lawmakers to vote against the electronic transmission is a coup against the people.</p><p>The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Abubakar Malami has reiterated the commitment of the federal government to the protection of human rights.</p><p>Malami gave the assurance of the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari to the protection of human rights during the inauguration of the governing council of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).</p><p>The AGF also praised the President for doing the right thing with the suspension of the former commander of the Police Intelligence Response Team, DCP Abba Kyari, over allegations of bribery by the United States government through the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the case involving Hushpuppi.</p><p>The Ooni of Ife, Adeyeye Enitan Ogunwusi has expressed the support of traditional rulers in the South-West for Yoruba Nation agitator, Sunday Igboho, who is standing trial in the Benin Republic.</p><p>The monarch noted that efforts of solidarity and support are ongoing for Igboho, adding that everything could not be said in the public space.</p><p>The spokesman of the monarch, Moses Olafare in a statement released on Tuesday said it is unreasonable to believe that traditional rulers from the South-West did not show support for the agitation.</p><p>He further stated that the fact that they are not revealing their action does not mean they are not acting.</p><p>Longer jumper, Ese Brume has won the first medal for Nigeria at the ongoing Tokyo 2020 Olympics.</p><p>Brume’s 6.97m jumped came just short of 0.3 of Germany’s Malaika Mihambo’s 7.00m and American Brittney Reese’s 6.97m.</p><p>The African record holder leapt to a distance of 6.76m, 1cm more than the required mark to seal her place in the final.</p><p>Brume became Nigeria’s only athlete in the jumps, following the disqualification of Ruth Usoro by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU).</p><h2><strong>That’s the top Nigerian newspaper headlines for today.
