Force Public Relations Officer, CP Frank Mba who spoke on the matter on Thursday said when the helicopter which took off from Abuja arrived in Bauchi, there was no light on the runway at the airport.</p><p>He added that the pilot tried to communicate with the control tower but nobody was there to respond after which he had to proceed to control landing during which process the tail rotor

Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) not to punish their ethnic group because of the line of business they are involved in.</p><p>Naija News understands the group spoke against the backdrop of the decision of the state government through the Benue State anti-grazing law to increase the fine on confiscated livestock from N2000 per cow to N50,000.</p><p>The Miyetti Allah said its members can’t afford such a heavy fine, adding that the law doesn’t apply to citizens of the state who are involved in the same business.</p><p>The Chairman of MACBAN in Benue State, Risku Mohammed called the attention of Governor Ortom to the issue during a press conference addressed in Makurdi, the state capital.</p><p>The chairman who spoke through an interpreter, his secretary, Ibrahim Galma said the new law is capable of chasing Fulani herdsmen away from the state.</p><p>President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday cancelled his expected visit to Zamfara State, citing poor weather conditions.</p><p>The development was announced by the state Governor, Bello Matawalle, noting that Buhari who was scheduled to take off from Sokoto aboard a helicopter, had to postpone the visit due to poor

Mr President said he would reschedule the visit to the state next week and the fixed date would be communicated to us in due course.</p><p>“Some of the security chiefs are currently in Katsina but can’t fly to Zamfara for the same reason.
