It was an unexpected tweet, so it made sense when it was explained that the renown political editor's <a href=#>Twitter account was hacked</a> — or so he said. Today, we learned that Scully actually sent the tweet, and that C-SPAN put him on administrative leave for lying about it.</p><p>To make this more complicated, Scully was scheduled to moderate the second presidential debate, which got canceled. For the last week, Scully's tweet had riled up the right wing media, and it seemed like Scully had enough and wanted to come clean. "For several weeks, I was subjected to relentless criticism on social media and in conservative news outlets regarding my role as moderator for the second presidential debate, including attacks aimed directly at my family," Scully said today in an official statement.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"C-SPAN suspended its political editor Steve Scully indefinitely Thursday after he admitted to lying about his Twitter feed being hacked when he was confronted about a questionable exchange with former Trump aide <a href=#>@Scaramucci</a>," <a href=#>@dbauder</a> reports <a href=#>https://t.co/Tih5uDC15C</a></p>— Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) <a href=#>October 15, 2020</a></figure><p>He added, “This culminated on Thursday, October 8 when I heard President Trump go on national television twice and falsely attack me by name. Out of frustration, I sent a brief tweet addressed to Anthony Scaramucci. The next morning when I saw that this tweet had created a new controversy, I falsely claimed that my Twitter account had been hacked. These were both errors in judgement for which I am totally responsible. I apologize."&nbsp;</p><p>C-SPAN apologized for the tweet and for Scully's actions, and seem to be hinting to some kind of future with the editor at some point again, due to his stellar reputation. "During his 30 years at C-SPAN, Steve consistently demonstrated his fairness and professionalism as a journalist. He has built a reservoir of goodwill among those he has interviewed, fellow journalists, our viewers, and with us...after some distance from this episode, we believe in his ability to continue to contribute to C-SPAN,"<a href=# rel=nofollow> the network stated</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>C-SPAN on Thursday suspended host Steve Scully after he admitted to falsely claiming his Twitter account was hacked last week; he had been scheduled to moderate this week's presidential debate before it was canceled. <a href=#>https://t.co/eYYY5uUPHZ</a></p>— NBC News (@NBCNews) <a href=#>October 16, 2020</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What did Steve Scully tweet?</h2><p>Scully simply tweeted "@Scaramucci should I respond to trump," on October 8 after Trump called Scully a "Never Trumper." The outrage seems to be coming from the fact that someone with Scully's journalistic integrity acted unprofessionally, and that he lied about it. During a time in which it's getting harder and harder to separate real from fake news, this is a pretty big deal, even if his tweet may sound harmless. When a political journalist lies about his account getting hacked to get out of taking accountability for tweeting at someone (formerly) from the Trump admin, it's not a good look.</p><p>It also fed fuel to the fire, unfortunately. Trump tweeted, "I was right again! Steve Scully just admitted he was lying about his Twitter being hacked. The Debate was Rigged! He was suspended from @CSPAN indefinitely. The Trump Campaign was not treated fairly by the 'Commission'. Did I show good instincts in being the first to know?"&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I was right again!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) <a href=#>October 15, 2020</a></figure><p>And conservatives aren't passing up this opportunity to show Scully's hypocrisy. And even left-leaning folks are scratching their heads, wondering why Scully would damage his career and C-SPAN's reputation like this.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Steve Scully just admitted he was not hacked and he lied.
