But something big happened between <a href=#>Angela</a> and <a href=#>Matt</a>, and there were clips making the rounds online before it was shown on TV that show how volatile things got after just a short time in the house.</p><p>Viewers saw Angela win the first Head of Household competition in the July 21, 2024 episode of Big Brother. But at a time where she should be enjoying her early reign in the house, it looks like Angela has anything but that on her mind. Instead, she has a rivalry with Matt, whether it is one-sided or not. And those who don't watch the <a href=#>Big Brother feeds</a> as steadfast as other fans finally got a taste of it on the show. So, what happened between Angela and Matt? We have the details!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened between Angela and Matt on 'Big Brother'?</h2><p>According to the live feeds, Angela took issue with Matt allegedly working with other people in the house to collude with them against her. This doesn't appear to be the case, though Matt isn't exactly one of Angela's BFFs in the house. However, she has plenty of claims when she confronts him in the kitchen in the early hours of the morning after what appeared to be a sleepless night for her in the HOH room.</p><p>"Awesome Matt, thank you, Crazy Eyes. You have frickin' crazy eyes," Angela tells Matt on the feeds, as the other houseguests watch on. "And for the house, for this beautiful [wonderful] group of people, and for the visitors that came to visit me last night, your performance was great."</p><p>She adds, "I have not been myself. I haven't thought clearly, I haven't been able to remember people's names."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>LMFAOOO THIS IS HOW IT ACTUALLY STARTED-A SLOW ASS CLAP THAT THE HGS ALL JOINED IN ON BC THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING 😭😭😭 <a href=#>https://t.co/zXdd6Ssj4Q</a></p>— sal (@sanguinesal) <a href=#>July 20, 2024</a></figure><p>Angela says she is sleep deprived and she accuses Matt of taking advantage of that while he allegedly worked to turn the house against her. At this point in the game, there aren't any solid alliances that can't be broken easily, though. So even if Matt is trying to turn the house against Angela, it's far too early to get this worked up about the game, as it can change at the drop of a hat.</p><p>Viewers saw some of this play out on Big Brother. But now, according to one fan;s in-depth recap of what happened between the Big Brother houseguests, we have a clearer idea of what's going on and what happened.</p><p>According to the user on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, Matt and Makensy spoke about going after Angela from the time the feeds went live. So in that regard, Angela isn't as paranoid as some might think.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>"what did matt even do!!!!!!!"</p><p>this reddit user really just spelled it out very clearly much love to them <a href=#>#BB26</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/fPVZImAgyJ</a></p>— ᴛᴍʙ (@evictionnominee) <a href=#>July 25, 2024</a></figure><p>The user went on to explain that, from other houseguests' views, Matt speaks to others in a "condescending" manner, which is why he has less allies than Angela. Still, they admitted, the way Angela went about confronting Matt and blowing up on him shows how "polarizing" she is as a player.</p><p>"They definitely hid Matt's role in all this beyond the one-on-one where we where at least we got clarification on him threatening her," they wrote, about Big Brother production edits. "He didn't aggressively threaten her, but he did low-key threaten her IMO."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Matt working with on 'Big Brother 26'?</h2><p>Matt, Makensy, Rubina, Cam, and Cedric do appear to have an alliance together with three other people. Again, though, alliances can change easily, especially those that are formed early on and built on the early stress of the game.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Plus, majority alliances don't do well for the entire season, anyway, and eight people in an alliance makes this one big enough to turn on itself sooner rather than later. Regardless of what happened between Angela and Matt on Big Brother and what alliances are working for or against Angela, it's still anyone's game.</p><p>Watch Big Brother on Sundays at 9 p.m. EST and then on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. EST on CBS and Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnBnquwnZWjeqK6xp6jmmWRo7FuucCtq2aamZx6o77OrZ%2Beqg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-angela-and-matt-big-brother.html&text=What%20Happened%20Between%20Angela%20and%20Matt%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-between-angela-and-matt-big-brother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-angela-and-matt-big-brother.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Angela%20and%20Matt%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-angela-and-matt-big-brother.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Angela%20and%20Matt%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-angela-and-matt-big-brother.html&title=What%20Happened%20Between%20Angela%20and%20Matt%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-between-angela-and-matt-big-brother.html&description=What%20Happened%20Between%20Angela%20and%20Matt%20on%20Big%20Brother%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./breaking-10th-nass-crisis-rocks-apc-as-wase-doguwa-reject-tinubus-consensus-candidates.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Crisis Rocks APC As Wase, Doguwa Reject Tinubu's Consensus Candidates">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./647048-dpr-distributes-hoarded-fuel-motorists-free-charge-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="DPR Gives Out FREE Fuel To Motorists In Kwara">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
