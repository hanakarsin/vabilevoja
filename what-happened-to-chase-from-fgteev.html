Short for "Family Gaming Teams Extraordinarily Entertaining Videos," this team of gamers has generated a massive following on <a href=#>YouTube</a> with regular gaming videos and other vlog content all by actively participating in gaming activities as a close-knit family in all-ages settings.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The group as a whole consists of the many members of the Skylander family, including parents Moomy (Samantha Carter) and Duddy (Vincent Carter) and their four children. From the oldest to youngest, there's Lexi, Mike, Chase, and Shawn. Their family even includes three dogs: Oreo, Ollie, and Callie.</p><p>The family is most often seen in group videos alongside each other, but that doesn't mean they don't lead their own lives.</p><p>In fact, second-youngest child <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chase</a> has been the subject of several rumors.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Chase from FGTeeV?</h2><p>Chase Skylander is the second youngest child of the Skylander siblings, having been born on Oct. 1, 2011. He has been featured in several different FGTeeV videos and even previously ran a separate channel that focuses solely on the kids called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TheSkylander Boy and Girl</a> on YouTube.</p><p>He's been active on the channel throughout its decade-plus-long history, being nearly as old as the channel itself. His many birthdays and milestones have even been featured on the channel.</p><p>Millions of fans have been tracking Chase's life as he practically grew up on FGTeeV, but all that attention can be overwhelming for someone at such a young age. Luckily, he seems to have drawn the line when it comes to his mental health.</p><p>Several <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reports</a> state that in February 2023, Chase posted a video announcing that he was taking a break from the channel in order to recover from the stress that came with his online presence. He even stopped posting on his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">social media accounts</a> shortly after.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>This prompted several rumors about him, even including the rumor that he may have died given his lack of presence for several months. However, he would later reappear in FGTeeV videos later in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">May 2023</a>, actively participating in his family's gaming content once again.</p><p>However, Chase has resurfaced at a time when most of the FGTeeV team seems to be on a break.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to FGTeeV? Several death rumors have been spread, including a rumor that FGTeeV Mom died.</h2><p>Many of the members of FGTeeV have seemed to pull back on their social media posts in 2023, including that of mom Samantha Carter. Rumors of her death began to circulate among fans after her Instagram posts seemingly halted in February 2023, but she would <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">post</a> again in May 2023 with a video in which she spends time with her children.</p><p>As for the channel as a whole, it appears to still be active. Vincent Carter has posted several solo videos throughout May 2023.</p><p>It's safe to say that FGTeeV has taken on a different form as of late, but there have been no reported tragedies among the Carter family as of this writing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScoJGosm6y0aikZp6XqbKmwg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-chase-from-fgteev.html&text=What%20Happened%20to%20Chase%20From%20FGTeeV%3f%20Rumors%20Have%20Spread&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-chase-from-fgteev.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-chase-from-fgteev.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Chase%20From%20FGTeeV%3f%20Rumors%20Have%20Spread" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-chase-from-fgteev.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Chase%20From%20FGTeeV%3f%20Rumors%20Have%20Spread" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-chase-from-fgteev.html&title=What%20Happened%20to%20Chase%20From%20FGTeeV%3f%20Rumors%20Have%20Spread" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-chase-from-fgteev.html&description=What%20Happened%20to%20Chase%20From%20FGTeeV%3f%20Rumors%20Have%20Spread" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hot-mess-house-bug-categories.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'Hot Mess House' Host's Bug Categories for Messy People  Details!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./spiros-focas-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Spiros Focas - Trivia, Family, Bio">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
