The Dolphins originally stated he had a head injury, but he returned to the field after halftime.</p><p>Although the Dolphins claim they followed the NFL concussion protocol, the NFLPA has launched an investigation and pledged to pursue "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every legal option</a>" for a potential protocol violation following Tua's frightening injury during TNF.</p><p>Keep reading for all the known details regarding what happened to Tua Tagovailoa.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NFL on Prime Video</span><p>QB Tua Tagovailoa after he went down hard during 'TNF.'</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Tua Tagovailoa?</h2><p>During the second quarter of TNF, Tua went to make a pass; however, Bengals defensive lineman Josh Tupou lunged at the quarterback and sacked him. Tua smashed the back of his head on the ground, and his hands appeared to seize up almost immediately. He stayed down for several minutes before he was placed on a stretcher and taken off the field.</p><p>The Dolphins soon <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a> that Tua would be out for the rest of the game with head and neck injuries. The organization also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a> that the University of Alabama alum "had been taken to a local hospital for further evaluation," noting that he was conscious and had "movement in all his extremities."</p><p>Tua was discharged late Thursday night and traveled back home with the Dolphins.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tua Tagovailoa's obvious concussion from last week will be under even more intense scrutiny following this. The NFLPA has already launched an investigation. Let's hope Tua is alright. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/pWYss5XUdZ</a></p>— Sidelines Sports Network™ (@Sidelines_SN) <a href=#>September 30, 2022</a></figure><p>Following the game, Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel stated Tua has a concussion.</p><p>"I could tell it wasn't the same guy that I was used to seeing," Mike said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a>. "It was a scary moment. He was evaluated for a concussion. He's in the concussion protocol, but he's being discharged." He added, "It's an emotional moment. It's not a part of the deal you sign up for." Mike also noted Tua received treatment and "it's nothing more serious than a concussion."</p><p>The entire sports community rallied together and wished the best for Tua following that scary incident, with fellow quarterbacks <a href=#>Patrick Mahomes</a> and <a href=#>Russell Wilson</a> tweeting they would be praying for him. Also, former NFL stars <a href=#>Chad Ochocinco</a> and Ryan Shazier prayed that the injury wouldn't keep Tua from ever playing football again.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">When will Tua Tagovailoa return?</h2><p>As of this writing, there's been no reports on when Tua will return to the field; however, given the severity of his concussion and the stronger protocols, it's likely Dolphins fans won't see him on the field for at least one or two games.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The NFLPA stated that Tua's situation is their top priority.</h2><p>As we stated before, the NFLPA launched an investigation into the Dolphins' handling of Tua's concussion assessment on Sept. 25 after he took a hard hit during the second quarter vs. the Bills. Tua stumbled off the field, but he apparently cleared protocol and eventually returned to the game after halftime.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Player health and safety is at the core of the union's mission. Our concern tonight is for Tua and we hope for a full and speedy recovery. Our investigation into the potential protocol violation is ongoing.</p>— NFLPA (@NFLPA) <a href=#>September 30, 2022</a></figure><p style=text-align:start>After the nasty hit he took during Thursday Night Football, the NFLPA tweeted, "player health and safety is at the core of the union's mission. Our concern tonight is for Tua, and we hope for full and speedy recovery."</p><p style=text-align:start>"Our investigation into the potential protocol violation is ongoing," they concluded.</p><p>During Thursday's postgame press conference, Mike McDaniel emphasized that he and the Dolphins did not tinker with the NFL's concussion protocol. "That's why the NFL has these protocols, and there's not like every single NFL game that is played," he said, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NFL.com</a>. "There's an independent specialist that specializes in specialty brain matter, so for me, as long as I'm coaching here, I'm not going to fudge that whole situation."</p><p>He continued, "If there's any sort of inclination that somebody has a concussion, they go into concussion protocol; it's very strict. People don't vary or stray; we don't mess with that, we never have as long as I've been head coach, so it'd never be an issue that you guys have to worry about."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGStrZFiwaKzzq%2BYoqSflg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tua-tagovailoa.html&text=Dolphins%20QB%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%20Left%20%27Thursday%20Night%20Football%27%20on%20a%20Stretcher&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-tua-tagovailoa.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tua-tagovailoa.html&title=Dolphins%20QB%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%20Left%20%27Thursday%20Night%20Football%27%20on%20a%20Stretcher" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tua-tagovailoa.html&title=Dolphins%20QB%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%20Left%20%27Thursday%20Night%20Football%27%20on%20a%20Stretcher" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tua-tagovailoa.html&title=Dolphins%20QB%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%20Left%20%27Thursday%20Night%20Football%27%20on%20a%20Stretcher" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-tua-tagovailoa.html&description=Dolphins%20QB%20Tua%20Tagovailoa%20Left%20%27Thursday%20Night%20Football%27%20on%20a%20Stretcher" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./new-law-can-be-reviewed-presidency-defends-buhari-signing-of-pib.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ew Law Can Be Reviewed'">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./what-did-kanye-say-about-rosa-parks.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Did Kanye West Say About Rosa Parks?
